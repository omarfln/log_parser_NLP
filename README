This project is a stater project for an NLP solution to analyze build, simulation and lint logs generated by EDA tools like VCS by Synopsys Inc. 
The purpose of this project to train the moduke over some common build, sim and lint issues, then the mosule is capable to categorize any new (not part of the training dataset) failure and suggest a fix
The categorization and fix suggestion are all in human readble language (English only)

Features
1- Detect Common Build & Simulation Errors (Make, Vivado, Verilator, GCC, etc.)
2- Auto-Suggest Fixes using a fine-tuned T5 model
3- Supports Unknown Failures with a similarity-based search
4- Uses TF-IDF & NLP to match errors to past failures
5- Beam Search Optimization to generate human-readable fixes

Under the hood:
1- Preprocesses error logs by tokenizing and vectorizing them.
2️- Categorizes errors using TF-IDF & DBSCAN clustering.
3️- Fine-tunes a T5 model on a dataset of errors and their fixes.
️4- Generates meaningful fixes using beam search instead of random sampling.
5- Detects new errors and suggests the most likely fix.

To exeute the module you may run it on top of Google colab. The trainig dataset provided is slightly small, i.e. need more trainig dataset
